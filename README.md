# Water_Potability_prediction_using_MachineLearning
This is my Machine Learning Course project. Dataset is collected from kaggle. I have tried to predict drinkable water looking at different features.
Drinkable Water is the most important things for all human beings. The target of this project was to predict drinkable water from looking at other features of the water. My aim was to make things easier for people and by helping them finding drikable water easily so thay can prevent diseases like cholera,Diarrhoea.
